Then open [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-responsive-list is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

```
npm install react-responsive-list --save
```


## Usage

To use, import { Table, Thead, Tbody, Tr, Th, Td } from 'react-responsive-list'.. Then, copy or import the index.css file into your project. Write your html table with capitol letters, and voilÃ !

`Table` supports `breakPoint` prop, which will set, when to make your table mobile. Default is 600.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Table, Thead, Tbody, Tr, Th, Td } from 'react-responsive-list'
import 'react-responsive-list/assets/index.css'

const MyAwesomeTable = () => (
    <Table breakPoint={700}>
        <Thead>
            <Tr>
